\dnum[Coins]
Diego, a pirate, loves to gamble when he is not scrubbing the decks or
plundering booty. But lately he has been on an unlucky streak, so he decides to study probability theory so that he will have an advantage the next time he tries his luck in the gambling dens ashore.

He starts by thinking about his favorite thing: gold coins. If Diego flips a coin 3 times, what is the probability that he  gets 3 heads in a row? When all outcomes are equally likely, the \textbf{probability} of a particular result can be calculated with the formula
\begin{equation*}
  \text{Probability of a particular result} 
  = \frac{\text{Number of ways the result can happen}}
  {\text{Number of possible results that can happen}}.
\end{equation*}
When Diego flips a coin 3 times, there are 8 possible results that can happen:
\begin{equation*}
  HHH,\quad HHT,\quad HTH,\quad HTT,\quad THH,\quad THT,\quad TTH,\quad
  \text{and}\quad TTT.
\end{equation*}
Out of these possible results, only one has 3 heads, so the probability that
Diego gets 3 heads in 3 flips is $\frac{1}{8}$.

\begin{problem}[Coin Flipping] Suppose Diego flips a coin three times in a row. 
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (1 point) What is the probability that Diego get exactly 2 heads?
    \dicegamesanswerbox[$3/8$] 
    \item (1 point) What is the probability that Diego gets at least 2 heads?
    \dicegamesanswerbox[$1/2$]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\dnum[Standard Dice Problems]
Diego decides he's had enough of flipping coins and wants to start rolling some
dice. For the next three problems, assume the dice are standard 6-sided dice with
faces labeled 1,2,3,4,5, and 6, like this:
\begin{center}

\begin{problem}[Standard Dice: Joint Probabilities]
    Diego has two dice and he rolls both of them. He wants to know the probability that both of them land on 1. He draws the following table to represent all the possible outcomes:

        does not land on a 1?

\end{problem}


\begin{problem}[Standard Dice: Summing Problems] 
  Now suppose Diego rolls two dice and then adds the numbers together. The possible
  outcomes are
  \begin{equation*}
    2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, \text{ and }12
  \end{equation*}
  but these numbers  are not all equally likely. To help figure out the probabilities of the possible outcomes, Diego draws the following table on the back of one of his treasure maps:

\begin{problem}[Standard Dice: Expected Values]
The \textbf{expected value} of a dice roll is the value one would expect to
get \textbf{on average} if the dice roll were repeated many times. The expected
value can be calculated by adding up each possible outcome times that
outcome's probability. For example, the expected value for a roll of a single 6-sided dice (with faces 1,2,3,4,5, and 6) is:
\begin{equation*}
  \text{Expected value} = 1\times \frac{1}{6} + 2\times \frac{1}{6} + 3\times \frac{1}{6} + 4\times \frac{1}{6} + 5\times \frac{1}{6} + 6\times \frac{1}{6} = 3.5.

When Diego's pirate ship sinks in a storm, he washes up on a mysterious island and takes shelter in a cave. Upon exploring the cave, he finds an ancient
treasure chest containing three dice: one made of amethyst (A), one made of
black obsidian (B), and one made of an unknown crystal (C). The dice are unlike any dice he has ever
seen. They each have 6 sides, but they are not labeled 1 through 6. Instead,
their faces are labeled as follows:
